The output for the two replicas is different because they work in parallel and the load balancer distributes the load. In this case, execution in turn is not required and parallel execution allows for greater stability in operation. This is due to the line `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"`. To change the behavior, it is needed to change this line.
